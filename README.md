# generator-react-css-modulesify [![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url] [![Build Status][travis-image]][travis-url] [![Dependency Status][daviddm-image]][daviddm-url]
> React + css-modulesify + gulp + browserify

This generator creates a new frontend-only project using React. It makes no assumption on your backend. It transpiles all the stuff into `static` folder, and you can point your statics folder to it on your server, or link it anywhere you want.

The new project use css-modulesify to provide a webpack-like way of importing styles from css. It provides component scoped css isolation to avoid naming conflict.

Ideally a component will have a `name.js` under `src/components` and `name.css` under `src/css` if it needs its own styles.

## Installation

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and generator-react-css-modulesify using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-react-css-modulesify
```

Then generate your new project:

```bash
yo react-css-modulesify
```

## Usage

### Bundling

The project makes two bundles: one for vendors dependencies, which does not change very often, and one for your app. For every entry file, a compiled css file will be created under `statics/css` e.g. `main.css`.

You can define vendor dependencies and entry files by udpating `VENDORS` and `ENTRIES` in `gulpfile.babel.js` 

```bash
# Build vendor bundle
gulp build:vendor
# Build main.js
gulp build
# Build other entry
gulp build -f path/to/other-entry.js
# Build all entries if you have more than one
gulp build:all
```

### Watching

The project use [livereactload](https://github.com/milankinen/livereactload) to provide hot reloading.

```bash
# Watch mian.js
gulp watch
# Watch other entry
gulp watch -f path/to/other-entry.js
# Watch all entries if you have more than one
gulp watch:all
```

Note that you have to serve `index.html` with a server in order for the page to reach the live reload server. Also changes made to css files will not update automatically (yet), you have to manually refresh the page.
